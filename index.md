**Title:** Customizing Incentives for Behavioral Change: The Power of Price Discrimination     
**Abstract:** Incentives for health behaviors are an increasingly important policy tool in both developed and developing countries, and there is widespread interest in improving the effectiveness of incentive contracts. One promising strategy for improving incentive effectiveness is to customize contracts to individual traits. We adapt two common price discrimination mechanisms to customize incentive contracts for walking: tagging on observables, and offering a menu of contract choices. In doing so, we take into account four non-standard elements of our setting: individuals may have commitment motives for physical activity, manipulate observables, have imperfect private information over future walking costs, or be directly motivated by a sense of autonomy. We then evaluate the "Tag" and "Choice" mechanisms and find that both improve exercise in the contract period, leading to a 60% increase in steps walked relative to a one-size-fits-all benchmark. We next exame the channels driving the success of each mechanism: standard market sementation, commitment, tag manipulation, information and autonomy. Both mechanisms succeed in segmenting the market as in standard price discrimination, and both also serve as commitment devices. People do manipulate their tags, but it does not harm customization. People have imperfect information, and are sensitive to informational nudges, yet learning about walking costs does not seem to play an important role in contract choice. Finally, we find no strong evidence of autonomy effects.

**Title:** The economic and social value of forests: Evidence from tree mortality in the American West   
**Abstract:** Humans rely on healthy forests to provide numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits, yet these ecosystems have become increasingly vulnerable to widespread mortality events. This paper exploits a natural experiment to assess the welfare consequences of changes in forest health in the American West.  Using plausibly random changes in tree mortality generated by the specific temperature requirements of pests, I find that forest die-off has significant and economically meaningful impacts on both the market value of forests and the non-market amenity and environmental quality benefits these ecosystems provide.  I estimate that over the last two decades, tree mortality in American West has decreased the value of timberland by $744 million, decreased home values by $299 million, and increased damages from air pollution, wildfire, and flooding by more than $40 million per year.  These empirically-grounded estimates can assist decision-makers in trading off the costs and benefits of investments in forest health.

**Title:** Entertainment Utility from Suspense, Surprise, and Starpower   
**Abstract:** This paper uses revealed preference methods to explore and quantify demand for non-instrumental information in entertainment, examining the "thrill" associated with the trajectory of an event, and the "skill" associated with information-conveying agents. Relying on the theory presented in Ely et al. (2015, JPE), I produce an empirically testable conceptual framework that examines the effect of suspense and surprise on consumer attention, incorporating spectator preferences for starpower of the information-conveying agents. I use game-specific, high-temporal frequency secondary ticket marketplace and television ratings data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to measure spectator responses to suspense, surprise, and starpower. I find that suspense and starpower each enhance willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-watch (WTW) between 4-30% depending on specification, while surprise induces a smaller viewership response. Interestingly, I find a negative interactive effect between suspense and starpower, suggesting that heightened suspense leads to differentially higher viewership with lower starpower on the court. These findings have important implications for entertainment companies, including leagues and television broadcasters, and advertisers.

**Title:** The economic costs of NIMBYism: evidence from renewable energy projects    
**Abstract:** Large infrastructure projects can create widespread societal benefits and are often critical to tackling major national or global challenges. However, large infrastructure projects frequently prompt strong opposition from local residents and businesses. This is sometimes pejoratively labeled NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) behavior and is thought to be common in many settings, although the economic costs it imposes are poorly understood. In this paper I estimate the economic costs of so-called NIMBYism. To do this I examine the case of renewable energy in the United Kingdom where I am able to draw on detailed planning data for all renewable energy projects, including projects that were proposed but not approved. I first use hedonic methods to estimate how the construction of a wind or solar project is capitalized into local property values. I find that wind projects have significant negative local impacts whilst solar projects do not. I then quantify the weight that planning officials place on these local factors during the planning process and find evidence that they are indeed uniquely responsive to local property value impacts. This has resulted in societally beneficial projects being systematically refused, which may have contributed to increasing the cost of the UK's deployment of wind power by as much as 12-36%. I conclude by discussing policy solutions and suggest that the remedies tried to date are the right ones, but that they have been too small in scope.
