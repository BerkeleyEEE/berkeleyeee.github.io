**Title:** Does New Housing Construction Cause Displacement?: Evidence from San Francisco   
**Abstract:** San Francisco is gentrifying rapidly as an influx of high-income newcomers drives up housing prices and displaces lower-income longtime residents. Yet building new housing is controversial. While advocates insist that increasing supply is the only way to bring down prices, opponents fear that construction will jumpstart gentrification in new areas through spillover effects on the price of nearby housing. This paper identifies the causal impact of new construction on displacement by exploiting random variation in the location of new construction induced by serious building fires. I combine parcel-level data on new construction with panel data on individual migration history to test whether proximity to exogenous new construction impacts the risk of moving.  I find that proximity to new market rate construction reduces the risk of displacement by 4.7% per year and has no impact on gentrification.  New affordable construction and endogenous construction have no impact on nearby displacement or gentrification. Using an original dataset of historic Craiglist rents, I show that new market rate construction brings down nearby rents, reducing the likelihood of moving mainly among renters without rent control.

**Title:** Culpable Consumption: Public Shame and Residential Water Use     
**Abstract:** Consumer response to conservation policy is a key parameter of interest for public utilities. In particular, water utility districts around the country face difficult decisions during droughts and must find ways to incentivize consumer conservation behavior in order to meet self or state-imposed reductions. Public utilities are often constrained in their ability to use traditional pricing instruments, sparking interest in nontraditional instruments for evoking conservation behavior. This paper investigates the role of one such instrument: public shame. Drawing on unique variation in public shame exposure generated by media coverage of excessive water use during a recent drought ordinance in San Francisco's East Bay Area, I investigate whether exposure to public shame induced additional conservation response beyond that elicited by a fee. Analysis methods include instrumental variables, IV by  generalized random forests, and augmented synthetic controls.

**Title:** Taxation Toward Representation: Public Goods, Tax Collection, Social Norms, and Democratic Accountability     
**Abstract:** While theoretical and historical work has explored the relationship between public goods, taxation, social norms, and the formation of democratic institutions, there is a considerable gap in empirical evidence. Haiti is piloting a system for managing federal transfers and collecting municipal taxes which provides an opportunity to study the efforts of a weak state with extremely low tax compliance as it attempts to formalize society. I have partnered with the mayor of one of the largest cities in the country to implement a city-wide RCT of public goods, tax collection, and public exposure of tax compliance to identify effective interventions and disentangle channels for transitioning from a zero-tax equilibrium as well as the impact of such efforts on participation in formal channels of accountability including voting as well as participation in informal taxation and other non-governmental forms of civic engagement.

**Title:** Trade, Meat, and the Environment  
**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the environmental consequences of trade policy and gauges the true impact of the "buy local" rule on emissions. Using confidential data from a cooperation with a European retailer, I estimate a discrete choice model of consumer demand for meat products. Combining my estimates with emissions related to meat production and transport, I show the effects of tariff changes on the environment. The counterfactual exercises include autarky and free trade scenarios, an assessment of the EU's free trade agreement with the Mercosur, and the calculation of an environmentally optimal tariff.

**Title:** Addressing Market Frictions in Paying for Electricity in Rwanda     

**Abstract:** Abstract: Estimating the welfare impacts of rural electrification in low income countries is difficult because consumers in these settings typically face significant market frictions in both adopting and paying for electricity. Market frictions distort consumers' observed willingness to pay, so the resulting demand curves are not ideal for measuring welfare. I experiment with a service that substantially reduces relevant frictions in paying for electricity. Consumers exhibit inelastic demand for the service, suggesting that it substantially improves welfare. The service significantly increases demand for electricity on the intensive margin; however, the impacts are highly heterogeneous. I propose a model of liquidity constraints and transaction costs that can explain seemingly conflicting empirical results.

**Title:** Heterogeneity in firm level flaring: identifying a culture of pollution and noncompliance   

**Abstract:** The recent increase in petroleum production in the United States resulting from technological breakthroughs in unconventional oil and gas production techniques has been accompanied by record amounts of flaring of associated gas. State agencies that oversee the oil and gas industry in petroleum rich states, such as the Railroad Commission of Texas and the North Dakota Industrial Commission, regulate the duration and quantity of permissible routine gas flaring. Despite existing regulations and stated industry buy-in to reduce flaring, the volume of flared gas has climbed in recent years. Firm level heterogeneity in the US oil industry characterized by varied ownership structure, scale of operations, and regional presence, renders the oil industry a rich landscape to examine how heterogeneity in firm management practices affects environmental pollution outcomes, such as flaring, that have climate change and public health consequences. In this paper, I exploit both exogenous changes in flaring policies within-state and across-states, and use both a difference-in-differences approach as well as a spatial border regression discontinuity approach, to examine how firm characteristics affect flaring outcomes. Furthermore, this paper is the first to distinguish between firm level reported and actual flaring behavior by combining administrative well and lease level oil production and flared volume data with a novel remotely sensed well level flared volume dataset. This allows me to discern how firm characteristics enable strategic reporting and whether that is accompanied by true changes in flared volumes.
