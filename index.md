**Title:** Credit, psychology, and the adoption of profitable energy efficient technologies in Kenya  

**Abstract:** What is the role of credit and psychology in the adoption of profitable technologies? We use an incentive compatible Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism to elicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) and randomize adoption of an energy efficient cookstove in a field experiment with 1,000 households in Nairobi. We estimate that the technology has an average annual internal rate of return of 300%, saving $120 per year - around one month of income. Current adoption rates are inefficiently low: household WTP is only $12. Households would need to have a discount factor of 0.88 per week to rationalize this. To understand why, we cross-randomize access to credit with an intervention designed to increase attention. The attention treatment has no impact, but credit doubles WTP and closes the energy efficiency gap. We then study the psychology of credit: time-inconsistency, partially caused by inattention to future costs, increases the impact of credit and lowers WTP under credit constraints. Finally, since nearly half of global emissions reductions under the Paris agreement are to come from energy efficiency gains - largely in low-income contexts - our results have strong implications for policies seeking to regulate environmental externalities using Pigovian taxation in the presence of credit constraints.

**Abstract:** Large infrastructure projects are critical to tackling major national or global challenges. However, any large project also creates highly concentrated local impacts for nearby residents and businesses. The creation of local winners and losers can result in fierce lobbying during the project approval process, and where these efforts are successful socially beneficial investments may be abandoned. This kind of NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) behavior is common, but the scale of the welfare costs it imposes are poorly understood. In this study I use detailed data on planning applications for all renewable energy projects in the United Kingdom to estimate the social costs of local lobbying. I first use hedonic methods to estimate how the construction of a new project is capitalized into local house prices. I then examine how the scale and distribution of these house price effects determines the likelihood of projects being approved. Lastly I estimate the forgone benefits of projects that were unsuccessful, and consider the feasibility of using transfers to reduce opposition to projects that create significant welfare gains. I find that a modest targeted transfer scheme could have substantially increased UK electricity generation from renewable sources, or achieved the same level today at much lower cost.
