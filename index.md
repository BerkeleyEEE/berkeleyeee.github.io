#### ERE student work-in-progress presentations begin at 12:10PM. Presentations conclude at 1pm or 1:30pm, depending on the number of presentations. Post-doc presentations begin at 12:10PM and conclude at 1pm. Practice job talks and EEE visiting faculty seminars begin at 12:10PM, and last for 80 minutes. The seminar will be in-person this year. Due to budget constraints, no food will be provided -- please bring lunch with you!

## Seminar Description
This year will look a lot like pre-covid years.  [Faculty (EEE) seminars](https://eeeseminar.berkeley.edu/fall-2022/) will meet on a few Wednesdays; student (ERE) presentations will take place on the weeks that there is no EEE seminar(schedule below).  All energy/environment/resources faculty and grad students are encouraged to attend both seminars!

The ERE faculty strongly encourage students and post-docs in the field to present on a regular basis. In practice, this means that students should present at least once a year starting in their third year. For post-docs, there are often slots open early in the semester, so feel free to indicate your preference for early Fall.

While the student seminar is meant for “work-in-progress”, the faculty’s hope and expectation is that students will prepare/refine their presentation as much as possible in advance. Students are encouraged to meet with faculty/students/visitors well in advance to vet ideas and gather preliminary feedback. The faculty also ask that students share slides with their advisor at least one week prior to the scheduled talk in order to get some more targeted feedback, prior to the presentation.

**Title:** Energy Transition and Transportation Networks: Estimating the Economic Impact of Natural Gas Pipelines  
**Abstract:** By allowing for the development of new major shale formations, innovations in hydraulic fracturing changed the spatial distribution of energy production in the United States. Did transportation networks efficiently expand in order to bring fracked gas to market? I develop a model of pipeline investment where frackers contract with pipeline operators to expand pipeline capacity between supply and demand areas and pipelines can exert market power over the price of capacity expansions.  Testing predictions from the model with a novel dataset on pipeline contracts, I show that supply regions where pipelines have significant pre-existing market power under-invest in capacity expansions, leading to incomplete market integration. This finding highlights the importance of addressing market power in transportation infrastructure as the energy sector shifts towards renewable electricity.

**Title:** Environmental Drivers of Agricultural Productivity Growth: CO2 Fertilization of US Field Crops  
**Abstract:** Post-war growth in agricultural productivity outpaced the US non-farm economy, spurred by steadily increasing crop yields. We argue that rising atmospheric CO2 is responsible for a significant share of these yield gains. We present a novel methodology to estimate the CO2 fertilization effect using data from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. Our study complements the many field experiments by regressing county yields on local CO2 levels across the majority of US cropland under actual growing conditions. For identification, we utilize year-to-year anomalies from county-specific trends, an instrument for those CO2 anomalies using wind patterns, and a spatial first-differences approach. We consistently find a large CO2 fertilization effect: a 1 ppm increase in CO2 equates to a 0.4%, 0.6%, 1% yield increase for corn, soybeans, and wheat, respectively. In a thought exercise, we apply the CO2 fertilization effect we estimated in our sample from 2015-2021 backwards to 1940, and, assuming no other limiting factors, find that CO2 was the dominant driver of yield growth–with implications for estimates of future climate change damages.

**Title:** The Growing Risk and Burden of Wildfire Smoke  
**Abstract:** We study the growing societal burden of wildfire smoke.  Using a combination of remote sensing, machine learning, and causal inference, we quantify how exposure to wildfire-sourced particulate matter is changing across the contiguous US. We then use this information in a number of downstream tasks:  we develop a new metric of wildfire severity related to population smoke exposures, we quantify the contribution of wildfire smoke to overall pollution trends, and we link smoke exposures to the universe of emergency department visits in CA to understand health impacts.

**Title:** Liquid Markets: An Empirical Analysis of a Water Exchange  
**Abstract:** This paper empirically analyzes the performance of one of the world’s most developed water exchanges, which operates as a primitive limit order market.  Upon modeling participants’ incentives to shade their order prices and their choice between limit and market orders, I identify the distribution of participants’ willingness to pay (or accept) from the observed orders and trades.  The model flexibly allows for dynamics, risk aversion, and default behavior.  Counterfactual simulations suggest the observed exchange attains substantially lower trade surplus than periodic uniform-price market clearing.  The exchange exhibits noticeable price dispersion, which enables suboptimal buyer-seller matching and incentivizes price shading.

**Title:** Global Warming and Labor Market Reallocation  
**Abstract:** Global warming is a phenomenon expected to have heterogeneous effects across geographic locations and economic sectors. To assess its welfare consequences and the reallocation of workers across different markets, I develop a dynamic economic model with the patterns of structural transformation and spatially distinct labor markets facing varying exposure to warming damages on productivity. I incorporate trade of goods and migration across regions and industries, to account for the ability of agents to adapt to this phenomenon, and non-homothetic preferences, to reproduce the reallocation of economic activity when income grows. To measure workers' mobility, I collect data from censuses and population surveys, and employ methodologies from the demographic literature to provide novel estimates of worldwide bilateral migration flows. To identify the non-linear effects of temperature on productivity, I exploit weather fluctuations in a long panel and find that agricultural productivity in the hottest countries declines by 6% when temperature rises 1ºC. The model, quantified for 6 sectors and 287 countries and subnational units, suggests that workers in agriculture face welfare losses three times larger than the average worker and that employment in this sector increases. Although hot regions might reduce the production of agricultural goods and import them from less affected locations, sectoral specialization is mainly driven by the shift in consumption expenditure towards the subsistence goods, as warming reduces global income.

**Title:** The Marginal Impact of Emission Reductions  
**Abstract:** Many people think they can at most have a small impact on climate change through their own actions, limiting the demand for individual emission reductions. Currently available statistics are not suited to systematically assess this belief. In this paper, I derive the marginal impact of emission reductions – the effect of reducing emissions by 1tCO₂ – for tangible climate change outcomes, document important misperceptions and show how they affect behaviour. Using climate models, I estimate the marginal impact for glacier ice melting, life expectancy and vegetation change. Subjects’ beliefs are inconsistent with the climate model findings in several ways. First, they substantially underestimate the marginal impact. Second, they think the marginal impact increases when others reduce their emissions (strategic complementarity). By contrast, for most outcomes, climate models predict strategic substitutability. Third, they falsely believe there are discontinuities at known temperature thresholds, after which the marginal impact significantly decreases. Providing subjects with the climate model findings causally increases perceived self-efficacy, intentions to reduce emissions and real donations to mitigate them. The findings are consistent with a model of threshold thinking, which predicts positive overall reductions of information provision in equilibrium.

**Title:** Predicting Yields at Scale using Remote Sensing (with Joel Ferguson and Kangogo Sogomo)  
**Abstract:** We develop a procedure to feasibly produce remotely sensed agricultural outcome measures (such as crop yields) using publicly available survey data and large scale satellite imagery. Our approach builds upon the methodology of You et al. (2017) to introduce a dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to train a convolutional neural network in a setting in which the training data are much more aggregated than the level of the satellite imagery, yet maintains the temporal and spatial features necessary for accurate crop discrimination. Additionally, we develop a methodological toolkit that can be used by other researchers to select, download, query, and run analyses on large scale sets of imagery where such images must be stored locally on computing clusters. The primary application of our procedure is to predict maize yields in Mexico, using high resolution satellite imagery obtained for all of the states in Mexico.

**Title:** The Sharing Economy as a Disaster Remedy: The Case of Airbnb  
**Abstract:** How to handle the logistics for short-term displacements remains a critical yet underexplored question in disaster relief. This paper explores the welfare impacts of the home-sharing platform Airbnb on disaster accommodation, in the context of wildfire evacuation near Los Angeles. I develop a structural model of short-term housing choice highlighting two welfare channels. First, the option of Airbnb accommodation has a peer effect that increases consumer surplus for all. Second, the altruistic sharing creates a transfer to customers who enjoy a lower-than-usual price. I find evacuees to Los Angeles obtain a welfare gain of $192k per day of evacuation from the Airbnb option, of which only $17.5k come from the altruistic sharing. Substantial benefits fall on regular travelers due to the failure of evacuee targeting. Only a subset of households in good social-economic status conducts altruistic sharing, while other hosts also suffer from a welfare loss due to the price spillovers. I suggest enabling customer targeting can correct the home-sharing accommodation as an equitable transfer from altruistic households to disaster evacuees.

**Title:** Institutions, Comparative Advantage, and the Environment: Why are Developing Countries Polluted?  
**Abstract:** I propose a new reason why developing countries have high levels of air and water pollution: financial, judicial, and labor market institutions provide comparative advantage in clean industries. Weak institutions make countries poor and polluted; strong institutions make countries rich and clean. Strong national institutions attract clean production, even conditional on environmental regulation and factor endowments. Cross-country differences in the composition of output between clean and dirty industries explain more of the global distribution of emissions than differences in the techniques used for production do. Partial equilibrium calculations and a quantitative general equilibrium model suggest that strengthening institutions in countries with weak baseline institutions would substantially decrease their pollution through relocating dirty industries abroad, though would correspondingly increase pollution in high income countries.

**Title:** Willingness to Pay for Electricity Reliability: Evidence from U.S. Generator Sales  
**Abstract:** Power outages and unreliable electricity supply have potentially high economic costs; however, existing empirical evidence on the magnitude of these costs or the value of electricity reliability is limited. In this paper, I provide some of the first revealed preference estimates of household willingness to pay to avoid power outages (also referred to as residential value of lost load) using a defensive expenditures approach. Combining this approach with proprietary, store-transaction level sales data for all generators sold at Lowe’s Home Improvement stores from 2012-2020, I find that a household is willing to pay $1.16/kWh of avoided outage. Given this estimate, I perform various back-of-the-envelope evaluations of potential utility investments in improved reliability, the outage-related costs of hurricanes, and total household willingness to pay to avoid average annual outages, which I calculate to be over $1 billion per year.

**Title:** Temperature impacts on mobility in New York City: Evidence of unequal, compounding heat risks  
**Abstract:** Adversary effects of heat stress have been identified across a range of disciplines. The usage of public transit can lead to increased heat stress through waiting times in the sun or in hot stations underground, lack or air-conditioning in trains, or passenger density. In New York City, subway stations frequently experience higher temperatures than above ground which can become particularly dangerous on hot days. In this study, we assess the temperature dependence of the mobility behavior in New York City using daily turnstile data for 439 subway stations from 2014 to 2019. A binned fixed-effects panel-regression model is applied to assess the general influence of temperature on subway usage in New York City. Preliminary results show a quasi-quadratic relationship between temperature and mobility with sharp near-linear decays in mobility for hot and cold temperatures. Isolating the warm response (>17°C) we perform separate linear regressions for neighborhoods (ZCTA level). The results show disparities across New York City. Relating these results to the New York City Heat Vulnerability Index which captures the geospatial distribution of heat risk in New York City based on a number of environment and socioeconomic indicators, we find that areas already at a higher risk experience smaller reductions in mobility. These results suggest that neighborhoods already at a socioeconomic disadvantage disproportionally bear the additional burden of heat stress caused by public transit and are limited in their ability to mitigate it.

**Title:** The Carbon Footprint of Global Trade Imbalances  
**Abstract:** A large share of global carbon emissions arises in the production of goods that are consumed in a different country and from burning fossil fuels that have been extracted yet elsewhere. The flows of carbon embodied in trade are highly asymmetrical, decoupling territorial emissions (or what we will call production footprints) from consumption footprints and from what we call extraction or supply footprints. At the same time, trade is highly and persistently unbalanced in value terms, too, allowing this decoupling to be even more pronounced — with a priori ambiguous environmental consequences. Prominently, the two countries with the largest net ex- and imports of carbon (China and the US) have at the same time consistently been among the countries with the largest trade surplus and deficit, respectively, and many large fossil fuel exporters have been running persistent trade surpluses. We investigate the effects of global value trade imbalances on carbon emissions around the world. To this end, we build a Ricardian quantitative trade model including sectoral input-output linkages, trade imbalances, fossil fuel extraction, and carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion. For every individual country, the emission effect of removing its trade imbalance depends on the carbon intensities of its production and consumption patterns, as well as on its fossil resource abundance. The simultaneous removal of all global trade imbalances is found to lower world carbon emissions by 0.62 percent or 184 million tons of carbon dioxide. Out of all individual countries’ imbalances, eliminating the Qatari trade surplus and the US trade deficit would lead to the largest environmental benefits in terms of lower global emissions.

**Title:** Welfare and Congestion  
**Abstract:** Sufficient statistics have proven to be a very useful tool for measuring welfare changes. Our paper extends this literature in three ways: First, we extend the theory for estimating the welfare impacts of price changes by including externalities that affect consumption decisions. Second, we apply the theory to an area of growing policy importance: congestion pricing. We develop estimates of peak and off-peak demand elasticities for urban mass transit in San Francisco using a large natural experiment and a natural field experiment that subsidized travel across 4.8 million trip sessions. Third, we estimate the welfare impacts for these subsidies using a sufficient statistics approach and a marginal value of public funds (MVPF) approach, and provide a way to connect these approaches. Our analysis suggests that off-peak subsidies can increase welfare, but the positive effects are reduced when consumers take the decisions of others into account compared to when they do not. We also find a large variation in the welfare impacts of shifting travel to different periods, which is explained by differences in demand and congestion characteristics. Finally, we show that the targeting of subsidies can increase welfare, but need not do so if the regulator does not have accurate information on demand.

**Title:** Price Discrimination in Residential Electricity Markets  
**Abstract:** This paper studies determinants of pricing heterogeneity in an unconcentrated market for a nearly homogeneous good. In doing so, I uncover some adverse efficiency and distributional impacts of enabling competition when consumers face large search frictions. Price competition for residential electricity supply results in substantial price dispersion, with low-income households and marginalized communities paying systematically higher electricity prices than their higher-income counterparts. I show theoretically that these patterns are consistent with a model in which firms price discriminate on search frictions and compete through marketing that raises equilibrium costs. Auxiliary analyses largely rule out alternative explanations. I estimate a structural model that shows that price discrimination in the Baltimore electricity supply market leads to an annual welfare loss of 12% of total industry variable costs. The primary cause of price differences across low- and high-income communities is geographic variation in marketing. This variation is driven by geographic differences in marketing costs and, to a lesser extent, differences in willingness to sign up with a marketer. However, eliminating marketing increases prices faced by low-income communities in the short run due to an interaction between marketing and price discrimination on inattention-driven inertia. The main results leverage billing data from Baltimore Gas and Electric, but I confirm several pricing patterns in other U.S. retail electricity markets.

**Title:** Planetary-Scale Digital Agriculture via Remote Sensing  
**Abstract:** As the world works toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals, data gaps hinder our ability to measure progress and target interventions. Meanwhile, rapid advances in computer vision and satellite imagery give us the opportunity to extract knowledge about the Earth at planetary scale. Compared to field surveys, which are the traditional source of knowledge about human activities and natural ecosystems, satellites offer global coverage at low marginal cost. However, in order for us to realize the potential of satellite imagery, we must overcome a lack of ground labels, especially in the world's poorest regions. This talk will cover strategies for mapping agriculture from satellite imagery when ground labels are scarce. In particular, I discuss how (1) transfer learning and weak supervision enable country-wide crop field delineation in India and (2) meta-learning allows for adaptive land cover classification in new regions with few labels. I conclude with an example of how satellite image-based datasets can be used to estimate causal effects by showing the impact of wildfire smoke on crop yields in the US Midwest.

**Title:** Attribute-based Subsidies and Market Power: an Application to Electric Vehicles    
**Abstract:** Attribute-based subsidies are commonly used to promote the diffusion of energy-efficient products in industries with significant market power. We first develop a theoretical framework for optimal policy design that incorporates endogenous product attributes, environmental externalities, and market power. We then estimate an equilibrium model with endogenous product attributes using comprehensive data on China’s vehicle market. Simulations show that relative to attribute-based subsidies, uniform subsidies favor small and environmental-friendly vehicles but exacerbate the quantity distortion from market power for high-quality products. In contrast, subsidies based on the driving range and battery capacity or vehicle weight generate a large consumer surplus by improving product quality and mitigating market power. Among commonly used policies, capacity-based subsidies induce attributes valued by consumers, mitigate market power, and lead to the largest welfare gain at a moderate loss of environmental benefit. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating product-attribute choices and market power considerations in designing attributes-based policies.

**Title:** Tax credit structure and wind farm investment decisions  
**Abstract:** Policymakers face many choices about subsidy design, including forward-looking decisions about how long a subsidy should last and how it should be phased out. This paper analyzes how the lifespan and phaseout of production tax credits for wind energy affects wind farms’ investment decisions. Wind farms receive a production tax credit for their first ten years, but can requalify for additional tax credits by making investments to retrofit or replace parts of the wind turbines. I show descriptively that wind farms choose to retrofit shortly after ten years, and this is earlier than in places without a ten year policy. I also show that wind farms increased retrofits just before a planned phaseout of the tax credits in 2017. I then use this temporal variation in the value of the production tax credit as well as technology costs to estimate a dynamic single-agent optimal replacement model. I then examine wind farm investment under counterfactual tax credit lifespans and phaseouts.

**Title:** Electricity subsidy programs in practice: Evidence from COVID-19 relief in Ghana   
**Abstract:** During economic downturns, governments often provide transfers to protect some of their poorest constituents. These often take the form of in-kind transfers and subsidies government programs to distribute food, water, or electricity at low or no cost have been widespread during the 2020 global health crisis. We survey 1,200 households in Accra, Ghana who were eligible for an electricity subsidy program introduced in response to the COVID-19 crisis to assess the efficiency, distributional, and political implications of the program and identify opportunities for increasing the efficacy of government transfer programs. First, most households report valuing the subsidy only slightly less (and often more) than the equivalent amount in cash, presumably because the subsidized electricity is inframarginal to their optimal consumption. Providing relief through the existing electricity payments system also allowed some households to benefit quickly, but did not preclude delays in subsidy receipt or exclusion of certain recipients. Second, we identify regressivity in subsidy distribution, beyond the regressivity of providing greater subsidy amounts to households using more electricity. Households that pay a landlord for electricity and that share an electricity meter with other users both common setups for low-income electricity consumers in urban settings in the developing world are significantly less likely to have ever received the subsidy. Finally, we show that subsidy receipt increases support for the governing party but that respondents sour on the subsidies substantially when reminded that they might have to pay for them in the future.

**Title:** Sustainable Agriculture, Residue Burning, and Urban Infant Mortality: Evidence from Mexico   
**Abstract:** Agricultural fires in developing countries produce substantial amounts of particulate matter and contribute to urban air pollution. However, relatively little research has evaluated policies intended to reduce crop residue burning compared to other air pollution abatement strategies. We quantify the effects of a portfolio of extension programs promoting sustainable agriculture practices to almost 250,000 plots throughout Mexico on agricultural burning and infant mortality in urban localities. Using event study regressions, we show that the roll-out of extension services to 0.1° x 0.1° grid-cells was unanticipated and led to reductions in the number of agricultural fires. Subsequently, we find that at the mean area serviced by extension in 2019, localities have 20% fewer agricultural fires within 50 Km and 15% fewer infant deaths relative to the mean. Reductions in infant mortality are experienced year round, rather than concentrated in the agricultural burning season, and are completely driven by the amount of area upwind that receives extension. We estimate the programs' cost of delaying an infant death by a month to be about $3000, suggesting that promotion of sustainable agriculture can be a cost-effective policy for reducing air pollution-induced infant mortality.

**Title:** Who Gets a Bid? Racial Disparities in Price Quotes   
**Abstract:** When services are customized and priced on a case-by-case basis, sellers possess considerable leeway in whether to serve a customer and how much to charge if they do.  These types of markets are ubiquitous--including, among others, construction contracting, auto repair, and legal services.  Compared to firms with posted menus or fixed prices, firms offering customized services have more potential to discriminate based on customer characteristics. Inherent in these settings is the possibility of discrimination with respect to racial or ethnic characteristics.  Our research will investigate racial disparities in pricing and welfare for an expensive, durable investment---rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.

**Title:** Spillovers from Ancillary Services to Wholesale Power Markets: Implications for Climate Policy   
**Abstract:** In electricity markets, generators are rewarded both for providing energy and for enabling grid reliability. The two functions are compensated in separate markets: energy markets and ancillary services markets. We provide evidence of changes in the fuel mix in the energy market that is driven by exogenous changes in an ancillary services market. We provide quasi-experimental evidence and a theoretical framework for understanding the mechanism, showing that it results from the multi-product nature of conventional power plants combined with discontinuities in costs. As a result, policy changes relating to grid operations, grid reliability, or climate change could have unintended effects.

**Title:** A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Warnings: the Case of South Korean Air Pollution Alert System   
**Abstract:** Concerns over air pollution have been increasing due to anthropogenic emissions and natural disasters such as wildfires and dust storms. To reduce adverse health effects, an increasing number of countries have enacted air quality alert systems. However, it is unclear whether the resulting health benefits outweigh the costs associated with reduced economic activities and system maintenance. This project conducts a cost-benefit analysis of air pollution warnings focusing on the case of South Korea. Based on a regression discontinuity design, it estimates the reduction in respiratory morbidity spending using South Korea's universal healthcare data. This work further identifies the decrease in consumer demand utilizing the daily credit card spending dataset. Our results show that the health benefits considerably exceed the costs, which suggests the importance of the transparent and timely distribution of pollution information.

**Title:** What drives support for inefficient corrective policies? Evidence from a Nevada ballot initiative   
**Abstract:** I use an information provision experiment conducted around a vote on Nevada’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to study voter preferences for externality-correcting policies. I leverage exogenous variation in respondent beliefs induced by the experiment to model policy support as a function of voter perceptions of policy attributes (cost, effectiveness, and regressivity). I find that voting behavior is relatively unresponsive to perceived cost and perceived regressivity, but relatively responsive to perceived policy effectiveness. Using this model, I decompose differences in support for a performance-based policy (Nevada’s RPS) and a hypothetical price-based policy (a carbon tax). Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions imply that differences in perceptions of policy attributes explain just 23% of the gap in support between RPS policies and carbon taxes, suggesting a significant role for “tax aversion.” To the extent that misperceptions of policy attributes do explain differences in support for these two policies, the explained gap results from overly optimistic beliefs about RPS attributes. To conclude, I predict voting behavior several under counterfactual scenarios. I find that in this setting, targeting revenue toward “swing” voters is unlikely to significantly improve support for carbon taxes. Instead, the results of this experiment highlight the importance of communicating to voters the efficacy of price-based policies.

**Title:** Place Based Climate Policy   
**Abstract:** There is immense geographic heterogeneity in household carbon footprints across the US. This paper aims to understand whether this is the result of place-based constraints, such as under-provision of local public goods, and if so, what the implications are for optimal climate policy. I leverage migration across places to estimate what fraction of spatial heterogeneity is driven by preferences and sorting, and what fraction is driven by places themselves. I then use the relationship between place characteristics and emissions to identify potential opportunities for targeted, place-based investments and estimate the cost of achieving given carbon reductions under different policy scenarios.

**Title:** From Bargaining Power to Market Power: Evidence from Natural Gas Pipelines   
**Abstract:** Do changes in bargaining power of large firms contribute to increased market concentration and markups? This research project will try to determine if growing imbalances in bargaining power between firms in vertical markets have empirically contributed to rising markups using data from the US natural gas industry. Using data from 2004-2020 on bargained rates between natural gas shippers and pipelines, I estimate a structural model of the natural gas industry to measure annual mark-ups and bargaining power parameters for each pipeline-shipper pair. I estimate the extent to which variation in bargaining power explains rising markups. Finally, I explore the determinants of bargaining power using policy generated changes in regulatory stringency and market structure.

**Title:** Culpable Consumption: Public Shame and Excessive Water Use   
**Abstract:** Consumer response to conservation policy is a key parameter of interest for public water utilities. Utility districts around the country face difficult decisions during droughts and must find ways to incentivize consumer conservation behavior in order to meet state-imposed reductions (Weiser and Siders 2015). In California, policy design is further complicated by legal obstacles to traditional pricing instruments.This complexity, combined with recent improvements to our understanding of behavioral influences like social norms, peer effects, and nudges, has sparked policymaker interest in nontraditional policy instruments for evoking conservation behavior, especially among price-inelastic consumers. Using household-level consumption data for single family homes in the San Francisco East Bay Area, I investigate how residential customers changed their consumption behavior around the recent drought emergency and responded to policy-induced variation in both prices and social pressure. After discussing broader patterns in water consumption, I estimate water demand models for single-family homes and characterize heterogeneity in price-responsiveness across income and usage levels. Next, I incorporate data on public shame exposure induced by the EBMUD Excessive Use Penalty from 2015-2016 to estimate the extent to which public shame exposure induced additional conservation behavior beyond that elicited by drought surcharges.

**Title:** Measuring Economic Value of Patents Using Stock Market Response   
**Abstract:** I develop three measures of patent value based on stock market response,  including a publication-event measure, a grant-event measure, and a non-event-Tuesdays measure. These measures each assign a dollar value to each patent of public firms and make it possible to compare patent values across different fields and years. Empirical results show that the three measures often assign similar dollar values to a focal patent, suggesting the value measures are consistent with each other and thus can be pretty accurate. I use the estimated values to investigate which factors are most useful in predicting patent values before grant. I find that the number of independent claims at the time of publication plays the most important role. The number of dependent claims, numbers of pre-grant forward and backward citations also matter. Finally, I explore if the commonly used patent quality measures: number of forward citations and patent renewals are good proxies of patent values. Primitive empirical findings suggest forward citations and patent renewals are only loosely correlated with the economic value of patents and can only explain a small proportion of the latter.

**Title:** Discriminating on Inattention: Equity and Efficiency Implications in Retail Electricity Markets   
**Abstract:** We observe large price dispersion in many subscription markets. Using data from the Connecticut residential electricity market, I show that price dispersion is greater among existing customers than among new customers. I show that existing price dispersion theories cannot explain this fact and propose a new theory to explain price dispersion in subscription markets: discrimination on attention. I show that the data are consistent with key predictions of this theory. I present a model to test whether price discrimination on attention can rationalize the prices we observe. I also explore equity-driven rationales for policy intervention. I find evidence that this market creates transfers from low-income households to high-income households and from immigrants, Black, Hispanic, and mixed race households to white, non-Hispanic households. I propose using the new model to test which of three theories can explain the differences in prices between demographic groups: differences in attention, proposensity to switch suppliers, and bargaining outcomes. I discuss using the model to test equilibrium outcomes under counterfactual policies.

**Title:** Distributional Effect on Migration and Welfare of Amenity: Evidence of Air Pollution   
**Abstract:** Quantifying the sorting impact of amenity is complicated by the interdependence between neighborhood demographics and endogenous amenities. This paper will assess the GE effect of environmental amenities on heterogeneous migration, inequality and gentrification under the endogeneity of amenity, using variations in air pollution driven by wildfire smoke. I first document four stylized facts regarding inequality, endogenous amenities, wildfire smokes and air pollution. I next develop a model of dynamic residential choice with households holding heterogeneous preferences over endogenous and exogenous amenities. I will estimate the model using a novel microdata that links demographic information to the universe of housing transactions in the US.

**Title:** Can price discrimination incentivize behavioral change? Evidence from a randomized field experiment     
**Abstract:** Incentives for health behaviors are an increasingly important policy tool in both developed and developing countries, and there is widespread interest in improving the effectiveness of incentive contracts. However, people are different, and no one contract is most effective for everyone. The theory of price discrimination offers two promising strategies to effectively customize contracts: tagging on observables (i.e., 3rd-degree price discrimination), and offering a menu of contract choices (i.e., 2nd-degree price discrimination). We adapt each of these strategies to customize incentive contracts for walking. Using a randomized controlled trial among more than 5,000 adults in urban India, we show that both mechanisms increase physical activity, leading to a 60% increase in steps walked relative to the effect of a one-size-fits-all benchmark contract. Moreover, we find that a common force in health behavior settings - commitment motives - helps both mechanisms to sort agents into more effective contracts. In particular, time inconsistent agents demand contracts that commit their future selves to walk more, bringing their preferences in partial alignment with the principal and improving self-selection. Finally, we find limited evidence that lack of information about health behavior costs is a barrier to effective price discrimination. The results suggest that customization mechanisms have broad promise in preventive health settings.

**Title:** The economic and social value of forests: Evidence from tree mortality in the American West   
**Abstract:** Humans rely on healthy forests to provide numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits, yet these ecosystems have become increasingly vulnerable to widespread mortality events. This paper exploits a natural experiment to assess the welfare consequences of changes in forest health in the American West.  Using plausibly random changes in tree mortality generated by the specific temperature requirements of pests, I find that forest die-off has significant and economically meaningful impacts on both the market value of forests and the non-market amenity and environmental quality benefits these ecosystems provide.  I estimate that over the last two decades, tree mortality in American West has decreased the value of timberland by $744 million, decreased home values by $299 million, and increased damages from air pollution, wildfire, and flooding by more than $40 million per year.  These empirically-grounded estimates can assist decision-makers in trading off the costs and benefits of investments in forest health.

**Title:** Entertainment Utility from Suspense, Surprise, and Starpower   
**Abstract:** This paper uses revealed preference methods to explore and quantify demand for non-instrumental information in entertainment, examining the "thrill" associated with the trajectory of an event, and the "skill" associated with information-conveying agents. Relying on the theory presented in Ely et al. (2015, JPE), I produce an empirically testable conceptual framework that examines the effect of suspense and surprise on consumer attention, incorporating spectator preferences for starpower of the information-conveying agents. I use game-specific, high-temporal frequency secondary ticket marketplace and television ratings data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to measure spectator responses to suspense, surprise, and starpower. I find that suspense and starpower each enhance willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-watch (WTW) between 4-30% depending on specification, while surprise induces a smaller viewership response. Interestingly, I find a negative interactive effect between suspense and starpower, suggesting that heightened suspense leads to differentially higher viewership with lower starpower on the court. These findings have important implications for entertainment companies, including leagues and television broadcasters, and advertisers.

**Title:** Balancing the Purse and the Peace: Public Goods, Tax Collection, Social Norms and Political Protest   
**Abstract:** State formation requires increasing tax revenue while maintaining political stability. In this paper, to help understand how the state establishes a social norm of tax compliance and to identify how those efforts affect both revenue collection and protest participation, I conduct the first randomized controlled trial of public goods and tax collection - and I do so in a weak and politically volatile state with very low tax compliance. I do this in partnership with the national tax authority and the local government of one of the largest cities in Haiti. I cross-randomize for multiple years and at-scale across the entire city, the only public good provided broadly by the government, trash removal, as well as of the principal means of tax collection for the local government, hand-delivering property tax invoices. To identify mechanisms, I further randomize the framing of the invoices through various 'nudges' including a novel treatment to measure the effect of social norms, and I also collect a representative panel of survey data. Lastly, I introduce two novel metrics of political participation: measuring political speech by mapping all of the graffiti in the city, and measuring violent or destructive political unrest by monitoring the construction of barricades during protests. I find that quite contrary to the existing literature from more established states, attempting to collect taxes in a setting of initial state formation actually decreases tax compliance across a broad set of metrics. I also provide the first evidence of tax collection increasing political protest participation. However, I find evidence that providing public goods has the opposite effects: increasing tax payments on both the intensive and extensive margin while decreasing political protesting. Analysis of mechanisms and interactions indicate that social exposure of tax compliance in conjunction with public goods provide a pathway for peacefully establishing a social norm of tax compliance.

**Title:** The Extraordinary and Unexplained rise of unreported gas flaring among fracking firms    
**Abstract:** This paper evaluates the effect of an environmental policy aimed at reducing routine natural gas flaring and provides causal evidence of misreporting by unconventional oil and gas wells in the Bakken Shale. I overcome the challenge of relying on self-reported administrative data by constructing a novel monthly well level dataset to evaluate flaring and policy compliance between March 2012 - November 2019 in the Bakken. I employ a difference-in-differences estimation specification using North Dakota and Montana wells to evaluate the causal impact of a North Dakota flaring reduction policy on reported and true flaring in North Dakota. I find evidence that the policy reduced well level flaring by 6.7 (5.2 - 7.1) points in the remotely detected data, and by 6.1 (5.3 - 6.6) points in the self-reported data between October 2014 - October 2016, relative to flaring rates in the pre-policy period. However, I find evidence of misreporting November 2016 onward; I estimate that the policy on average reduced well level flaring by 6.7 (5.9 - 8.9) points in the remotely detected data, but that it reduced flaring by 15.8 (15.7 - 16.2) points in the self-reported data, relative to the pre-policy flaring rates. Furthermore, I find that the remotely detected statewide flared volumes grew from being 2.5% larger than the self-reported flared volumes between (122 BCF/year, and 118 BCF/year, respectively) 2012-2016, to being larger by 74% (227 BCF/year, and 131 BCF/year, respectively) between 2017-2019.

**Title:** The economic costs of NIMBYism: evidence from renewable energy projects    
**Abstract:** Large infrastructure projects can create widespread societal benefits and are often critical to tackling major national or global challenges. However, large infrastructure projects frequently prompt strong opposition from local residents and businesses. This is sometimes pejoratively labeled NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) behavior and is thought to be common in many settings, although the economic costs it imposes are poorly understood. In this paper I estimate the economic costs of so-called NIMBYism. To do this I examine the case of renewable energy in the United Kingdom where I am able to draw on detailed planning data for all renewable energy projects, including projects that were proposed but not approved. I first use hedonic methods to estimate how the construction of a wind or solar project is capitalized into local property values. I find that wind projects have significant negative local impacts whilst solar projects do not. I then quantify the weight that planning officials place on these local factors during the planning process and find evidence that they are indeed uniquely responsive to local property value impacts. This has resulted in societally beneficial projects being systematically refused, which may have contributed to increasing the cost of the UK's deployment of wind power by as much as 12-36%. I conclude by discussing policy solutions and suggest that the remedies tried to date are the right ones, but that they have been too small in scope.

**Title:** Adaptation Investment, Local Government Financing and the Municipal Bond Market   
**Abstract:** Adaptation investment by the public sector can affect both the supply and demand of local government financing. A large proportion of public adaptation investment in the U.S. is funded by FEMA hazard mitigation grant program, which disburses funds to state and local governments after a Presidential Disaster Declaration (PDD), as a share of total assistance given to the entire state. I use the idiosyncratic variation in timing and availability of hazard mitigation funds due to proration rules to study the impact of public investment in adaptation on disaster response, outstanding long-term debt issued by local governments, municipal bond yields and risk premia. There are three main findings. First, hazard mitigation funds reduce damage in subsequent major disasters. Second, counties exposed to higher level of climate risks have less outstanding long-term debt and pay less interests after receiving more hazard mitigation funds. Third, hazard mitigation funds reduce yields and risk premia for municipal bonds with shorter maturity and increase those for bonds with longer maturity issued by high-risk counties.
