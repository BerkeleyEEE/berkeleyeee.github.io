**Title:** Trade, Meat, and the Environment  
**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the environmental consequences of trade policy and gauges the true impact of the "buy local" rule on emissions. Using confidential data from a cooperation with a European retailer, I estimate a discrete choice model of consumer demand for meat products. Combining my estimates with emissions related to meat production and transport, I show the effects of tariff changes on the environment. The counterfactual exercises include autarky and free trade scenarios, an assessment of the EU's free trade agreement with the Mercosur, and the calculation of an environmentally optimal tariff.

**Title:** Heterogeneity in firm level flaring: identifying a culture of pollution and noncompliance   
**Abstract:** The recent increase in petroleum production in the United States resulting from technological breakthroughs in unconventional oil and gas production techniques has been accompanied by record amounts of flaring of associated gas. State agencies that oversee the oil and gas industry in petroleum rich states, such as the Railroad Commission of Texas and the North Dakota Industrial Commission, regulate the duration and quantity of permissible routine gas flaring. Despite existing regulations and stated industry buy-in to reduce flaring, the volume of flared gas has climbed in recent years. Firm level heterogeneity in the US oil industry characterized by varied ownership structure, scale of operations, and regional presence, renders the oil industry a rich landscape to examine how heterogeneity in firm management practices affects environmental pollution outcomes, such as flaring, that have climate change and public health consequences. In this paper, I exploit both exogenous changes in flaring policies within-state and across-states, and use both a difference-in-differences approach as well as a spatial border regression discontinuity approach, to examine how firm characteristics affect flaring outcomes. Furthermore, this paper is the first to distinguish between firm level reported and actual flaring behavior by combining administrative well and lease level oil production and flared volume data with a novel remotely sensed well level flared volume dataset. This allows me to discern how firm characteristics enable strategic reporting and whether that is accompanied by true changes in flared volumes.

**Title:** Culpable Consumption: Public Shame and Residential Water Use     
**Abstract:** Consumer response to conservation policy is a key parameter of interest for public utilities. In particular, water utility districts around the country face difficult decisions during droughts and must find ways to incentivize consumer conservation behavior in order to meet self or state-imposed reductions. Public utilities are often constrained in their ability to use traditional pricing instruments, sparking interest in nontraditional instruments for evoking conservation behavior. This paper investigates the role of one such instrument: public shame. Drawing on unique variation in public shame exposure generated by media coverage of excessive water use during a recent drought ordinance in San Francisco's East Bay Area, I investigate whether exposure to public shame induced additional conservation response beyond that elicited by a fee. Analysis methods include instrumental variables, IV by  generalized random forests, and augmented synthetic controls.

**Title:** Taxation Toward Representation: Public Goods, Tax Collection, Social Norms, and Democratic Accountability     
**Abstract:** While theoretical and historical work has explored the relationship between public goods, taxation, social norms, and the formation of democratic institutions, there is a considerable gap in empirical evidence. Haiti is piloting a system for managing federal transfers and collecting municipal taxes which provides an opportunity to study the efforts of a weak state with extremely low tax compliance as it attempts to formalize society. I have partnered with the mayor of one of the largest cities in the country to implement a city-wide RCT of public goods, tax collection, and public exposure of tax compliance to identify effective interventions and disentangle channels for transitioning from a zero-tax equilibrium as well as the impact of such efforts on participation in formal channels of accountability including voting as well as participation in informal taxation and other non-governmental forms of civic engagement.
