**Title:** Electricity subsidy programs in practice: Evidence from COVID-19 relief in Ghana   
**Abstract:** During economic downturns, governments often provide transfers to protect some of their poorest constituents. These often take the form of in-kind transfers and subsidies government programs to distribute food, water, or electricity at low or no cost have been widespread during the 2020 global health crisis. We survey 1,200 households in Accra, Ghana who were eligible for an electricity subsidy program introduced in response to the COVID-19 crisis to assess the efficiency, distributional, and political implications of the program and identify opportunities for increasing the efficacy of government transfer programs. First, most households report valuing the subsidy only slightly less (and often more) than the equivalent amount in cash, presumably because the subsidized electricity is inframarginal to their optimal consumption. Providing relief through the existing electricity payments system also allowed some households to benefit quickly, but did not preclude delays in subsidy receipt or exclusion of certain recipients. Second, we identify regressivity in subsidy distribution, beyond the regressivity of providing greater subsidy amounts to households using more electricity. Households that pay a landlord for electricity and that share an electricity meter with other users both common setups for low-income electricity consumers in urban settings in the developing world are significantly less likely to have ever received the subsidy. Finally, we show that subsidy receipt increases support for the governing party but that respondents sour on the subsidies substantially when reminded that they might have to pay for them in the future.

**Title:** Sustainable Agriculture, Residue Burning, and Urban Infant Mortality: Evidence from Mexico   
**Abstract:** Agricultural fires in developing countries produce substantial amounts of particulate matter and contribute to urban air pollution. However, relatively little research has evaluated policies intended to reduce crop residue burning compared to other air pollution abatement strategies. We quantify the effects of a portfolio of extension programs promoting sustainable agriculture practices to almost 250,000 plots throughout Mexico on agricultural burning and infant mortality in urban localities. Using event study regressions, we show that the roll-out of extension services to 0.1° x 0.1° grid-cells was unanticipated and led to reductions in the number of agricultural fires. Subsequently, we find that at the mean area serviced by extension in 2019, localities have 20% fewer agricultural fires within 50 Km and 15% fewer infant deaths relative to the mean. Reductions in infant mortality are experienced year round, rather than concentrated in the agricultural burning season, and are completely driven by the amount of area upwind that receives extension. We estimate the programs' cost of delaying an infant death by a month to be about $3000, suggesting that promotion of sustainable agriculture can be a cost-effective policy for reducing air pollution-induced infant mortality.

**Title:** Who Gets a Bid? Racial Disparities in Price Quotes   
**Abstract:** When services are customized and priced on a case-by-case basis, sellers possess considerable leeway in whether to serve a customer and how much to charge if they do.  These types of markets are ubiquitous--including, among others, construction contracting, auto repair, and legal services.  Compared to firms with posted menus or fixed prices, firms offering customized services have more potential to discriminate based on customer characteristics. Inherent in these settings is the possibility of discrimination with respect to racial or ethnic characteristics.  Our research will investigate racial disparities in pricing and welfare for an expensive, durable investment---rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.

**Title:** Can price discrimination incentivize behavioral change? Evidence from a randomized field experiment     
**Abstract:** Incentives for health behaviors are an increasingly important policy tool in both developed and developing countries, and there is widespread interest in improving the effectiveness of incentive contracts. However, people are different, and no one contract is most effective for everyone. The theory of price discrimination offers two promising strategies to effectively customize contracts: tagging on observables (i.e., 3rd-degree price discrimination), and offering a menu of contract choices (i.e., 2nd-degree price discrimination). We adapt each of these strategies to customize incentive contracts for walking. Using a randomized controlled trial among more than 5,000 adults in urban India, we show that both mechanisms increase physical activity, leading to a 60% increase in steps walked relative to the effect of a one-size-fits-all benchmark contract. Moreover, we find that a common force in health behavior settings - commitment motives - helps both mechanisms to sort agents into more effective contracts. In particular, time inconsistent agents demand contracts that commit their future selves to walk more, bringing their preferences in partial alignment with the principal and improving self-selection. Finally, we find limited evidence that lack of information about health behavior costs is a barrier to effective price discrimination. The results suggest that customization mechanisms have broad promise in preventive health settings.

**Title:** The economic and social value of forests: Evidence from tree mortality in the American West   
**Abstract:** Humans rely on healthy forests to provide numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits, yet these ecosystems have become increasingly vulnerable to widespread mortality events. This paper exploits a natural experiment to assess the welfare consequences of changes in forest health in the American West.  Using plausibly random changes in tree mortality generated by the specific temperature requirements of pests, I find that forest die-off has significant and economically meaningful impacts on both the market value of forests and the non-market amenity and environmental quality benefits these ecosystems provide.  I estimate that over the last two decades, tree mortality in American West has decreased the value of timberland by $744 million, decreased home values by $299 million, and increased damages from air pollution, wildfire, and flooding by more than $40 million per year.  These empirically-grounded estimates can assist decision-makers in trading off the costs and benefits of investments in forest health.

**Title:** Entertainment Utility from Suspense, Surprise, and Starpower   
**Abstract:** This paper uses revealed preference methods to explore and quantify demand for non-instrumental information in entertainment, examining the "thrill" associated with the trajectory of an event, and the "skill" associated with information-conveying agents. Relying on the theory presented in Ely et al. (2015, JPE), I produce an empirically testable conceptual framework that examines the effect of suspense and surprise on consumer attention, incorporating spectator preferences for starpower of the information-conveying agents. I use game-specific, high-temporal frequency secondary ticket marketplace and television ratings data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to measure spectator responses to suspense, surprise, and starpower. I find that suspense and starpower each enhance willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-watch (WTW) between 4-30% depending on specification, while surprise induces a smaller viewership response. Interestingly, I find a negative interactive effect between suspense and starpower, suggesting that heightened suspense leads to differentially higher viewership with lower starpower on the court. These findings have important implications for entertainment companies, including leagues and television broadcasters, and advertisers.

**Title:** Balancing the Purse and the Peace: Public Goods, Tax Collection, Social Norms and Political Protest   
**Abstract:** State formation requires increasing tax revenue while maintaining political stability. In this paper, to help understand how the state establishes a social norm of tax compliance and to identify how those efforts affect both revenue collection and protest participation, I conduct the first randomized controlled trial of public goods and tax collection - and I do so in a weak and politically volatile state with very low tax compliance. I do this in partnership with the national tax authority and the local government of one of the largest cities in Haiti. I cross-randomize for multiple years and at-scale across the entire city, the only public good provided broadly by the government, trash removal, as well as of the principal means of tax collection for the local government, hand-delivering property tax invoices. To identify mechanisms, I further randomize the framing of the invoices through various 'nudges' including a novel treatment to measure the effect of social norms, and I also collect a representative panel of survey data. Lastly, I introduce two novel metrics of political participation: measuring political speech by mapping all of the graffiti in the city, and measuring violent or destructive political unrest by monitoring the construction of barricades during protests. I find that quite contrary to the existing literature from more established states, attempting to collect taxes in a setting of initial state formation actually decreases tax compliance across a broad set of metrics. I also provide the first evidence of tax collection increasing political protest participation. However, I find evidence that providing public goods has the opposite effects: increasing tax payments on both the intensive and extensive margin while decreasing political protesting. Analysis of mechanisms and interactions indicate that social exposure of tax compliance in conjunction with public goods provide a pathway for peacefully establishing a social norm of tax compliance.

**Title:** The Extraordinary and Unexplained rise of unreported gas flaring among fracking firms    
**Abstract:** This paper evaluates the effect of an environmental policy aimed at reducing routine natural gas flaring and provides causal evidence of misreporting by unconventional oil and gas wells in the Bakken Shale. I overcome the challenge of relying on self-reported administrative data by constructing a novel monthly well level dataset to evaluate flaring and policy compliance between March 2012 - November 2019 in the Bakken. I employ a difference-in-differences estimation specification using North Dakota and Montana wells to evaluate the causal impact of a North Dakota flaring reduction policy on reported and true flaring in North Dakota. I find evidence that the policy reduced well level flaring by 6.7 (5.2 - 7.1) points in the remotely detected data, and by 6.1 (5.3 - 6.6) points in the self-reported data between October 2014 - October 2016, relative to flaring rates in the pre-policy period. However, I find evidence of misreporting November 2016 onward; I estimate that the policy on average reduced well level flaring by 6.7 (5.9 - 8.9) points in the remotely detected data, but that it reduced flaring by 15.8 (15.7 - 16.2) points in the self-reported data, relative to the pre-policy flaring rates. Furthermore, I find that the remotely detected statewide flared volumes grew from being 2.5% larger than the self-reported flared volumes between (122 BCF/year, and 118 BCF/year, respectively) 2012-2016, to being larger by 74% (227 BCF/year, and 131 BCF/year, respectively) between 2017-2019.

**Title:** The economic costs of NIMBYism: evidence from renewable energy projects    
**Abstract:** Large infrastructure projects can create widespread societal benefits and are often critical to tackling major national or global challenges. However, large infrastructure projects frequently prompt strong opposition from local residents and businesses. This is sometimes pejoratively labeled NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) behavior and is thought to be common in many settings, although the economic costs it imposes are poorly understood. In this paper I estimate the economic costs of so-called NIMBYism. To do this I examine the case of renewable energy in the United Kingdom where I am able to draw on detailed planning data for all renewable energy projects, including projects that were proposed but not approved. I first use hedonic methods to estimate how the construction of a wind or solar project is capitalized into local property values. I find that wind projects have significant negative local impacts whilst solar projects do not. I then quantify the weight that planning officials place on these local factors during the planning process and find evidence that they are indeed uniquely responsive to local property value impacts. This has resulted in societally beneficial projects being systematically refused, which may have contributed to increasing the cost of the UK's deployment of wind power by as much as 12-36%. I conclude by discussing policy solutions and suggest that the remedies tried to date are the right ones, but that they have been too small in scope.

**Title:** Adaptation Investment, Local Government Financing and the Municipal Bond Market   
**Abstract:** Adaptation investment by the public sector can affect both the supply and demand of local government financing. A large proportion of public adaptation investment in the U.S. is funded by FEMA hazard mitigation grant program, which disburses funds to state and local governments after a Presidential Disaster Declaration (PDD), as a share of total assistance given to the entire state. I use the idiosyncratic variation in timing and availability of hazard mitigation funds due to proration rules to study the impact of public investment in adaptation on disaster response, outstanding long-term debt issued by local governments, municipal bond yields and risk premia. There are three main findings. First, hazard mitigation funds reduce damage in subsequent major disasters. Second, counties exposed to higher level of climate risks have less outstanding long-term debt and pay less interests after receiving more hazard mitigation funds. Third, hazard mitigation funds reduce yields and risk premia for municipal bonds with shorter maturity and increase those for bonds with longer maturity issued by high-risk counties.
