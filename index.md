**Title:** Customizing Incentives for Behavioral Change: The Power of Price Discrimination     
**Abstract:** Incentives for health behaviors are an increasingly important policy tool in both developed and developing countries, and there is widespread interest in improving the effectiveness of incentive contracts. One promising strategy for improving incentive effectiveness is to customize contracts to individual traits. We adapt two common price discrimination mechanisms to customize incentive contracts for walking: tagging on observables, and offering a menu of contract choices. In doing so, we take into account four non-standard elements of our setting: individuals may have commitment motives for physical activity, manipulate observables, have imperfect private information over future walking costs, or be directly motivated by a sense of autonomy. We then evaluate the ``Tag'' and ``Choice'' mechanisms and find that both improve exercise in the contract period, leading to a 60% increase in steps walked relative to a one-size-fits-all benchmark. We next exame the channels driving the success of each mechanism: standard market sementation, commitment, tag manipulation, information and autonomy. Both mechanisms succeed in segmenting the market as in standard price discrimination, and both also serve as commitment devices. People do manipulate their tags, but it does not harm customization. People have imperfect information, and are sensitive to informational nudges, yet learning about walking costs does not seem to play an important role in contract choice. Finally, we find no strong evidence of autonomy effects.

**Title:** The economic and social value of forests: Evidence from tree mortality in the American West   
**Abstract:** Humans rely on healthy forests to provide numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits, yet these ecosystems have become increasingly vulnerable to widespread mortality events. This paper exploits a natural experiment to assess the welfare consequences of changes in forest health in the American West.  Using plausibly random changes in tree mortality generated by the specific temperature requirements of pests, I find that forest die-off has significant and economically meaningful impacts on both the market value of forests and the non-market amenity and environmental quality benefits these ecosystems provide.  I estimate that over the last two decades, tree mortality in American West has decreased the value of timberland by $744 million, decreased home values by $299 million, and increased damages from air pollution, wildfire, and flooding by more than $40 million per year.  These empirically-grounded estimates can assist decision-makers in trading off the costs and benefits of investments in forest health.
