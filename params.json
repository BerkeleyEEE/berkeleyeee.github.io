In particular, transmission capacity is reduced at extreme temperatures. I use this temperature-induced variation in the carrying capacity of transmission lines to estimate the effects of transmission congestion on firm behavior at natural gas combined-cycle power plants in the Texas electricity market. I find that offer prices to generate electricity more than double at the most extreme temperatures. I show this increase in the supply price is not driven by an increase in costs, but rather by firms exploiting the constraints of the transmission grid to increase markups. I estimate that during these hours of extreme heat, the price received by these plants increases twenty-fold. This evidence supports the conclusion that these plants are strategically increasing offer prices at times of constrained transmission to generate large economic rents. \r\n\r\n### 12 October 2016\r\n\r\n<img src = \"https://are.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/user_big_picture/public/pictures/picture-12991-1414092746.jpg\" width = \"200\" hspace = \"20\" alt = \"Kenny\">\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Kenny Bell\r\n<br>__Title:__ TBA\r\n<br>__Abstract:__ NA\r\n\r\n### 26 October 2016\r\n\r\n<img src = \"https://are.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/user_big_picture/public/pictures/picture-13008-1414091922.jpg\" width = \"200\" hspace = \"20\" alt = \"Jon\">\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Jon Kadish\r\n<br>__Title:__ TBA\r\n<br>__Abstract:__ NA\r\n\r\n### 09 November 2016\r\n\r\n<img src = \"https://are.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/user_big_picture/public/pictures/picture-13002-1444171251.jpg\" width = \"200\" hspace = \"20\" alt = \"James\">\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ James Gillan\r\n<br>__Title:__ TBA\r\n<br>__Abstract:__ NA\r\n\r\n### 30 November 2016\r\n\r\n<img src = \"https://are.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/user_big_picture/public/pictures/picture-12706-1414091315.jpg\" width = \"200\" hspace = \"20\" alt = \"Ed\">\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Ed Rubin\r\n<br>__Title:__ TBA\r\n<br>__Abstract:__ NA\r\n\r\n## Spring 2017 schedule\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### 18 January 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenters:__ Dina Gorenshteyn and Ellen Lin\r\n\r\n### 25 January 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Gavin McCormick\r\n\r\n### 01 February 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenters:__ Jon Proctor and Dave McLaughlin\r\n\r\n### 08 February 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenters:__ Susanna Berkouwer and Ken Lee\r\n\r\n### 22 February 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Danamona Andrianarimanana\r\n\r\n### 08 March 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Fiona Burlig\r\n\r\n### 22 March 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Louis Preonas\r\n\r\n### 12 April 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Deirdre Sutula\r\n\r\n### 26 April 2017\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Tamma Carleton\r\n\r\n## Past presentations\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### 14 September 2016\r\n\r\n<img src = \"https://are.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/user_big_picture/public/pictures/picture-13024-1438756749.jpg\" width = \"200\" hspace = \"20\" alt = \"Fiona\">\r\n\r\n__Presenter:__ Fiona Burlig (joint with Louis Preonas and Matt Woerman)\r\n<br>__Title:__ Panel Data and Experimental Design\r\n<br>__Abstract:__ How should researchers design experiments to detect treatment effects with panel data? In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the variance of panel estimators under non-i.i.d. error structures, which inform power calculations in panel data settings. We use simulation to demonstrate that, with correlated errors, traditional methods for experimental design result in experiments that are underpowered with proper inference. Our theoretical results enable us to correct these problems in both simulated and real data. This paper provides researchers with the tools to design well-powered experiments in panel data settings.",
