<br><strong>Title:</strong> Strategic Response to Environmental Regulation: Theory, and Evidence from the U.S. Freight Truck Industry
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Vintage-differentiated emission standards are widely used to regulate pollution from mobile and stationary sources. When a new standard is expected to increase the price of a new piece of equipment, forward-looking agents may choose to shift purchases ahead of policy implementation, which impacts the policy’s effectiveness and potentially biases analysts attempts to evaluate the impact of the program. To explore this, we develop a model of capital turnover, which predicts how forward-looking firms respond to costly regulation, and the impact of anticipation on the existing capital stock. We find the impact of anticipation depends primarily on the relative emissions rates of new, used and future pieces of capital, as well as the relationship between new-capital purchases and used-capital retirements. If sufficiently many pieces of higher-emitting, used capital are retired early, anticipation can provide net benefits. We test the predictions of our model empirically using a data set of monthly U.S. sales of new freight trucks around the time of EPA’s 2007 implementation of heavy-duty vehicle criteria pollution standards. Consistent with our predictions, we find evidence of a sales spike in the months before the policy took effect, and a sales slump after implementation. We show that prior estimates in the literature, which do not account for the effect of anticipation, significantly overstate the impact of the policy on sales. More broadly, our findings have important implications for regulatory impact analysis of markets in which agents can shift the timing of purchases in anticipation of new regulation.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> Natural gas elasticities, seasonal heterogeneity, and consumer behavior: Evidence from 300M+ bills
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> In 2016 natural gas became the United States' primary source of energy. This level of importance, coupled with the fact that natural gas's prevailing pricing policies have been shown to be potentially inefficient and regressive, suggests understanding residential natural gas consumption behavior is a first-order problem. In this paper, I provide causally identified estimates of residential natural gas demand elasticities using a panel of more than 300 million bills in California. To overcome multiple sources of endogeneity, I utilize the border between two major natural-gas providers, in conjunction with an instrumental variables strategy. I estimate the "pooled" elasticity of demand for residential natural gas is between -0.30 and -0.25. I also provide evidence that the residential elasticity of demand for natural gas varies both with season and with income.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> More Power Plants or Smarter Homes? The Economics of Achieving More Flexible Electricity Demand
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Technological innovations over the past decade have allowed for resources with time-varying costs to be priced more efficiently. Electricity remains a canonical example where the need to balance supply and demand in real-time can lead to substantial short-term fluctuations in the marginal cost of generation. Historically, supply has been built to meet demand, but internet-connected smart home devices now allow consumers to easily respond to changes in the incentive to consume electricity. To estimate the effect of these new technologies on the responsiveness of short-term electricity demand, I perform a field experiment where households are randomly encouraged to adopt smart home devices. With little ahead notice, participants then face random variation in the incentive to consume electricity during specific periods. I explicitly test the hypothesis that automation technologies improve responsiveness, but that increasing financial incentives can achieve similar outcomes. This framework allows me to evaluate the economic benefit of deploying smart home devices that facilitate short-term elasticity in the demand for electricity.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> Transportation Costs and the Spatial Structure of Cities
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Over four billion people globally live in rapidly growing urban areas. There are a broad set of interacting factors that give rise to a particular spatial organization of households and firms, such as physical features and land use policy. Transportation costs and real estate prices drive individuals’ decisions about where to work and live. These choices have substantial welfare implications: in the US, we collectively spend over 18,000 person-years commuting everyday and vehicle transportation results in externalities including air pollution, congestion, accidents, and fatalities. Despite high social costs, there is little empirical evidence on the effect of changes in transportation costs on equilibrium city structure. Leveraging the repeal of the National Maximum Speed Law, this paper provides the first quasi-experimental estimates of how a shock to transportation costs impacts real estate prices, firm location and employment, and urban expansion.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> Empirical estimation of the impact of climate change on livestock industries: The case of dairy
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> The vast majority of the land used in agriculture supports livestock systems, with most of this land in pasture. Due to concern about the environmental effects of changing land uses, and expected future demand increases for animal products, it is crucial to understand how these systems will react to future climate change. Using data on the quantity and quality of milk produced in New Zealand, this paper estimates the nonlinear relationship between weather and dairy production in a pasture-based system. I give suggestive evidence that accounting for heterogeneous response functions by season can have material impacts on climate impact projections.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> Strategic bidding and transmission congestion: Evidence from the Texas electricity market
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Competition in wholesale electricity markets depends importantly on the ability to transmit electricity throughout the power grid, which is sensitive to environmental factors. In particular, transmission capacity is reduced at extreme temperatures. I use this temperature-induced variation in the carrying capacity of transmission lines to estimate the effects of transmission congestion on firm behavior at natural gas combined-cycle power plants in the Texas electricity market. I find that offer prices to generate electricity more than double at the most extreme temperatures. I show this increase in the supply price is not driven by an increase in costs, but rather by firms exploiting the constraints of the transmission grid to increase markups. I estimate that during these hours of extreme heat, the price received by these plants increases twenty-fold. This evidence supports the conclusion that these plants are strategically increasing offer prices at times of constrained transmission to generate large economic rents.</p>

<br><strong>Title:</strong> Panel Data and Experimental Design
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> How should researchers design experiments to detect treatment effects with panel data? In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the variance of panel estimators under non-i.i.d. error structures, which inform power calculations in panel data settings. We use simulation to demonstrate that, with correlated errors, traditional methods for experimental design result in experiments that are underpowered with proper inference. Our theoretical results enable us to correct these problems in both simulated and real data. This paper provides researchers with the tools to design well-powered experiments in panel data settings.</p>
